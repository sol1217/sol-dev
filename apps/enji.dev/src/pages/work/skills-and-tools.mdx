I started my career as a web developer about 2 years ago. I've tried some programming languages, both Back-End, and Front-End (Phyton, Javascript, TypeScript).

Even though the scope of web development is broad, I was very interested and focused on **Front-End Development** and **UI/UX Design**.

---

## Front-End Developer

I love creating something that is clean and minimalistic, attractive and has value, and of course, easy to use.

I really enjoy creating websites with **rich UI components**, including:

- **Web application**,
- **Documentation pages**,
- **Contents layout**,
- **Dashboard layout**,
- and others.

But I still like to make simple website pages like **landing pages**.

### TypeScript And JavaScript

First of all, the programming language. I'm very used to using **TypeScript**, although website creation can be done using Javscript and sometimes Python.


### React JS And React Native

I really enjoy building single page application websites and React is my go-to library.

Also, I'm starting to use react native to build Android and IOS apps.

### HTML, CSS, SASS , Tailwind

Experience using HTML5 to structure web content, CSS3 proficiency to stylize web pages with precision, Sass and tailwind frames

### Node js

Practice in server and backend development using Node.js and knowledge of libraries such as Express.js.

### Python Language


Basic knowledge of python in development.

### Next.js

Knowledge in creating static and dynamic pages, SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation).
Also use Remix js in a challenge and project engagement.

## Mobile Developer

 **React Native**.

I am passionate about leveraging the power of React Native to build apps that not only look great but are also highly performant and responsive.

---

## UI/UX Designer

Designing user interfaces is something I'm really good at and I've been a UI/UX designer **from 2023 to present (2 years)**.

I'm always thinking about how to create the best possible user experience, in addition to creating visually appealing user interfaces.

The biggest challenge is finding the balance between creating a great user interface and an amazing user experience.

---

## Backend Developer

 **Node js, Express, MySQL**.

I enjoy designing and implementing backend architectures that support high-performance.

## Detail and Summary

I represent all data in labels to make it easier to read. The **underline indicator** shows how often I used the related item.
